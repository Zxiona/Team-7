## Business Case

### Problem Statement

Designed Car Park Locator - With more cars on the road and parking spaces becoming more scarce, a system to locate designated car parks is much needed. By providing access to available spots, information on parking standards, and the option to plan parking in advance, this effort aims to make it easier for drivers to locate designated parking lots. Drivers will be able to rapidly search for and identify nearby designated parking lots with the use of user-friendly software. Additionally, the app will provide details about the available locations, including their size, accessibility, and any unique requirements. Moreover, vehicles will be able to explore designated parking lots dispersed across the city, simplifying travel arrangements and enabling them to include these locations in their itinerary. The system also attempts to allow vehicles to reserve or pre-book parking places in specified lots, which should provide them comfort and peace of mind before they arrive.

### Business benefits

Implementing a dedicated parking finder programme has several benefits for businesses, such as improved resource utilisation and parking efficiency. In addition to reducing the amount of time spent searching for places and relieving traffic congestion, the software assists drivers in finding and booking designated parking spaces quickly. It also ensures that particular parking allocations, such as employee or disabled parking, are used efficiently. Additionally, the software expedites travel and reduces anxiety associated with locating a spot in a crowded area by allowing users to discover and reserve parking spots in advance.
