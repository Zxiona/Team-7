# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem Statement

Designed Car Park Locator - With more cars on the road and parking spaces becoming more scarce, a system to locate designated car parks is much needed. By providing access to available spots, information on parking standards, and the option to plan parking in advance, this effort aims to make it easier for drivers to locate designated parking lots. Drivers will be able to search for parking spots instantaneously using a user friendly app. Furthermore, the app will allow the user to check the details of the location for example the size and accessibility so the user can tell whether they can use the parking space. Moreover, car owners will be able to actively look for parking arrangements for the next time they are in the area, making parking in Bristol seamless. The app will also allow the user to pre-book parking spaces which benefits the user by giving them peace of mind when planning to go out into the city.

### Business benefits

Allows for users to have better utalisation of parking facilities and better insight for the user into where they are able to park . In addition to enabling the user to quickly find an available parking space in turn helping with traffic congestion, the app helps users by allowing them to book a designated parking space before arriving to the destination. It also allows parking spaces that may be unique to the user such as disabled parking to be able to find those spaces a lot faster and used a lot more therefore benefitting the public by allowing them to have parking spaces that they are able to use.

### Options Considered

Already apps on the appstore that specialise in this. An example of this could be JustPark Parking app.

### Expected Risks
There are many risks that are associated with this, the app fully relies on the fact that it provides real-time data in relation to parking spaces available meaing that if this is inaccurate users will be highly fustrated. having the public rely on the app too much may cause a problem when the app malfunctions as 
it may cause more traffic and confusion. Furthermore, increased app usage may theoretically cause all close parking spots to be used up because of the amount of users.

## Project Scope
