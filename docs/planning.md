## Business Case

### Problem Statement

Designated Car Park Finder - With the increasing volume of vehicles and the escalating challenges in finding suitable parking spaces, there exists a pressing need for a designated car park locator system. This project aims to assist drivers in locating designated car parks efficiently, ensuring they have access to available spaces, information on parking specifications, and the capacity to plan their parking ahead of time. The system intends to provide a user-friendly app enabling drivers to easily search and identify designated parking lots nearby, providing details about the available spots, including size, accessibility, and any specific requirements. Additionally, drivers will have the ability to explore designated car parks across the city, facilitating travel planning and integrating these spaces into their journey. Furthermore, the system seeks to allow drivers to reserve or pre-book parking spaces in designated lots, providing convenience and peace of mind before their arrival.
