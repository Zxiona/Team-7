# Implementation

## Introduction

Version V0.1 of the designated car park finder app using 51 rows of data from the "Bristol Open Data" Car Park database (https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/datasets/55a26718006b47bcade1db6232e82e48_5/explore). The app enables users to be able to track and use car parks more efficiently by giving all the data on car parks that are within a close vacinity or searched for. The app also allows users to pre-book spaces.
